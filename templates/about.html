                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">I am a multidisciplinary creative and emerging software developer based in
                        New York City. Originally from the suburbs of Texas, my path took an
                        unexpected turn when I was scouted to model while working as a
                        dishwasher at Chipotle. That moment launched a career that has taken
                        me around the world. I have lived in five different countries and
                        draw constant inspiration from global culture and travel.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now focused on merging creativity with technology, I am passionate
                        about using software development and UX/UI design to bring imaginative
                        ideas to life. With a foundation in fashion and photography, I see code
                        as another medium for expression that can be both functional and
                        beautiful.</p>
